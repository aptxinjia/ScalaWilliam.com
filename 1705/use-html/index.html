<h1>Why I will continue to use HTML for writing</h1>

<p>The key is control</p>

<p>WYSIWYG without HTML is asking for pain. I had been using Medium for a while but their editor broke a few times, randomly changing my content.

I am not happy with that. I also don't exactly own my own content and can't extract important information easily.

Such as number of visits, bounce time, at what point the person stopped reading the article etc.</p>


<p>If I used Markdown, I have pretty much zero flexibility. I want to make a particular link act
in a particular way, but I can't. SVG? Forget it. Custom JavaScript to enhance the page a little? Nope.

Automatically generate TOC? Nope. Transform Markdown to other Markdown? Nope. I'd rather use plain XML (oh yeah... XHTML)
to do everything.
</p>

<p>So from this point onward I'll be not just writing HTML, but also hosting it on servers that I control./p>
