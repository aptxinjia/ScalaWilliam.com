<p>I've been using OVH's services since 2009. This is mostly on the low-end:</p>

<ul>
<li>RPS (discontinued)</li>
<li>Kimsufi dedicated</li>
<li>VPS Cloud (higher end)</li>
<li>Domains</li>
<li>Web hosting</li>
<li>E-mail</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the many reviews of poor OVH support, I did not experience much issue.</p>

<p>The control panels are changing and can be confusing to use. I'd say that's the biggest downer.</p>

<p>The biggest up for me is their stuff just works. There were some downtimes but you always know about it quickly.</p>

<p>They did have multiple log-ins for different services which didn't work well for me.</p>
